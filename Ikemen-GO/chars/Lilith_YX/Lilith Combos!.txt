Inspired by Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha's Expert mode, which gave you a set of char's combos 
as a challenge, I've left a challenge for Lilith! Try your hardest to best these combos, 
and hone your skills! Any moves or terms you may not understand may be detailed in the movelist.

1: Basic Chain

;One of Lilith's most important annd generally safe chains.

;A Renda bonus is the added frame advantage when you repeat a weaker normal with itself.

-Stand LP x2

3: Knockdown Jump-In Chain

However, you must time it well, and make sure there is good spacing!

-Crouch LP
-Crouch MP
-Crouch MK
-Crouch HP

4: Dashing Frame-Link Combo

and because of Lilith's frame advantage, you can pull it off artificially!

6: Chain to Super Combo 2

Also, Renda bonus is your friend here.

With two bars, you can dish out major damage with this one.

10: Lilith's Bread and Butter
