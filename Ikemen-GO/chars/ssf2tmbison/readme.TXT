|Super Street Fighter II M. Bison/Vega by Vegeta 20XX|
\====================================================/
|||Version 1.00|||

As of the date of his creation, this is the only Super Turbo M. Bison ever made 
(same thing I said about Sagat, remember). For those who don't know the story
or downloaded this character because his name sounded cool, here it is: M. Bison
(Vega in Japan) is the head of an evil organiation named Shadaloo that engages
in any sort of crime. Bison himself is the wielder of an evil energy named 
"Psycho Power," which increases his fighting ability greatly. In order to find
the strongest fighters on the planet, he hosted the Second World Warrior tournament;
the purpose of which was to look for potential recruits for Shadaloo. His Psycho
Power allows him to screw with people's minds on top of beefing him up. He was
killed by a mysterious fighter named Akuma (Gouki) at the last second (though 
Capcom hasn't yet explained why he's still alive and kicking in SF 4).

==============Directions for FightFx.sff==============
Skip this section if you downloaded my Super Turbo Sagat or already have
the SSF2T screenpack (it's actually Super X, but whatever).

Copy it or move it into your data folder (or wherever you keep your fightfx) 
and overwrite the existing one with this one (or rename the existing one and copy/move 
fightfx.sff into your data folder).
